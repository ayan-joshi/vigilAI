## Problem:

Traditional facial recognition systems, while valuable, often struggle with blurred footage, obscured faces, and limited description inputs. This can hinder investigations and allow criminals to evade capture.

## Solution:

VigilAI bridges this gap by harnessing the power of AI to scan video libraries and identify individuals matching precise descriptions, even from poor-quality footage or witness accounts.

## Summary:

Imagine receiving a witness report describing a suspect in a brown jacket and tan pants. Simply enter this description into VigilAI, and it will scour your video library, presenting a dashboard of relevant footage clips containing possible matches. This empowers officials to:
- Expedite investigations: Quickly pinpoint suspects, save time, and prioritize leads.
- Combat disguise attempts: Overcome limitations of traditional recognition tools.
- Enhance public safety: Bring criminals to justice more effectively.

## Key Features:

- Advanced AI-powered detection: YOLOv5 and imageio provide robust, customizable object detection capabilities.
- Intuitive React-based frontend: Vite ensures a smooth, user-friendly experience.
- Video upload and description input: Submit video evidence and detailed descriptions.
- Dashboard with relevant clips: View concise, time-stamped results for prompt analysis.
- Scalable cloud deployment: Adapt to diverse project needs with ease.
